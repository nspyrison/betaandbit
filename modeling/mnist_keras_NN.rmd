This is looking the MINST dataset, a series of low resolution hand-darwn digits. It is a standard classification set for image analysis where each pixel can be treated as a variable in grey scale [0, 1]. each image is 28x28 or 784 variables, there are 60000 training obs, and 10000 test obs. More advances takes, such as Convectional NN aggregate over the surrounding 8 pixels for example to reduce the number of the variables. 

Specifically here we will be creating a sequentially nueral network and use that to classify the digits. We have previous installed Python 3.10, keras, and tensorflow with GPU (NVIDIA GPU required). I am excited to use `keras` & `tensorflow`, I think this should be using GPU computing for parallelization and hopefully near linear performance increase.


# Setup and data

```{r}
library(keras)
#Getting started with Keras for R
#The core data structure of Keras is a model, a way to organize layers. 
#The simplest type of model is the Sequential model, a linear stack of layers. 
#For more complex architectures, you should use the Keras functional API, 
#which allows to build arbitrary graphs of layers.

## Data setup -----
#loading the keras inbuilt mnist dataset
data<-dataset_mnist()
str(data)
siz <- object.size(data)
print(siz, units="Mb")

#Training Data
train_x <- data$train$x
train_y <- data$train$y
#Test Data
test_x <- data$test$x
test_y <- data$test$y

#converting a 2D array into a 1D array for feeding
#into the MLP and normalising the matrix
train_x <- array(as.numeric(train_x), dim = c(dim(train_x)[[1]], 784))
test_x  <- array(as.numeric(test_x),  dim = c(dim(test_x)[[1]],  784))
#scale to [0, 1]
train_x <- train_x / 255
test_x  <- test_x  / 255
#target to classification, of 10 digits
train_y <- to_categorical(train_y, 10)
test_y  <- to_categorical(test_y, 10)
```

# Nueral network structure
```{r}
#Now defining a keras MLP sequential model containing a linear stack of layers
#defining the model with 1 input layer[256 neurons], 1 hidden layer[128 neurons] 
#with dropout rate 0.4 and 1 output layer[10 neurons]
#i.e number of digits from 0 to 9

model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  #Input layer-256 units
  #Add a densely-connected NN layer to an output
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = "relu",
              input_shape = c(784)) %>%
  #dropout layer to prevent Overfitting
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>%
  #Hidden Layer-128 units
  #Apply an activation function to an output.
  #Relu can only be used for Hidden layers
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = "relu") %>%
  #dropout layer to prevent Overfitting
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>%
  #output layer; 10 digits
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = "softmax")
#softmax activation for Output layer which computes the probabilities for the classes
#Compiling The Model
#Model's summary-showing its architecture
summary(model)
```

Essentially the structure is somewhat similar with:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*_SH7tsNDTkGXWtZb.png)

Though the specifics for our case are: 

1) first hidden layer is has a full 256 nodes (relu shape)
2) dropout layer, learning = 0.4
3) second hidden layer is has a full 128 nodes (relu shape)
4) dropout layer, learning = 0.4
5) output layer, of the desired 10 digit classification (softmax shape)


# Compile, train, & performance
```{r}
#Compiling the Model and Optimizing the model
#Configure a Keras model for training using compile()
model %>%
  compile(loss ="categorical_crossentropy",
          optimizer = "adam",
          metrics = c("accuracy"))

##Training the Model
#Now let's train the model on the training dataset  
#epochs = No of iterations on a dataset.
#batchsize = Number of samples per gradient update.
tictoc::tic("CNN fit")
history <- model %>% fit(
  train_x, train_y, epochs = 10, batch_size = 128,
  callbacks = callback_tensorboard(log_dir = "logs/run_b"),
  validation_split = 0.2) 
tictoc::toc()
#train on 80% of train set and will evaluate 
#model's metrics such as loss and accuracy on leftover data
#after training --model gives

summary(history)
history$params
history$metrics #gives loss and accuracy metric for each epoch
```


# Ploting model performance by epoch

```{r}
#plotting Model history - epoch vs acc and Loss
plot(history, labels = T)
which.min(history$metrics$acc)
which.max(history$metrics$acc)
#Accuracy least for 1st epoch and highest for last epoch-10

#Plotting acc vs loss
require(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(epoch    = 1:10,
                 accuracy = history$metrics$accuracy,
                 loss     = history$metrics$loss)
ggplot(df, aes(accuracy, loss, color = epoch)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Accuracy vs Loss over epoch",
       x = "Accuracy (train data)",
       y = "Loss (train data)")

#Now Finally evaluating the Model's Performance
#Evaluating model on the Test dataset
score <- model %>%
  evaluate(test_x, test_y, batch_size = 128)
score
