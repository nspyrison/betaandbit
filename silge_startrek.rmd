# Gist

I am using this as an intro to tidymodels and workflowsets. I am following along with Julia Silge's analysis and video post. See https://juliasilge.com/blog/star-trek/ for the blog and video.


# Setup

```{r}
if(F)
  install.packages(c("tidyverse", "tidymodels", "tidytext", "tidylo"))

library(tidyverse)
computer_raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-08-17/computer.csv")

computer_raw %>%
  distinct(value_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  count(char_type)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
